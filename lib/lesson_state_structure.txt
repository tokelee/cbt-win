    the current Highlighted subject;

    the current Question number;
    example value 1

THE RADIO TILES
for an option to be thicked, the value must be same
as the group value.

hence, i used a list "answeredQuestons" to store the answered Questions
in a format of [question number, option letter (a,b,c,d) and correct answer]
when there is no corresponding string for a list of options in a radio tile
all radios maintain their value, else, we set the group value to the one that 
matches the one in the answeredQuestons to thick the option.

i will be adding subject in front of it now. because it is not just about the 
[question number, option letter (a,b,c,d) and correct answer] now it wil be
[subject, question number, option letter (a,b,c,d) and correct answer]
